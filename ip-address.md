# IP Addresses

Documentation prefixes are not used as placeholders, because some specific
examples, like bogon networks will contain them verbatim.

To be decided how prefixes should be defined, perhaps just letters, to make it obvious they are variables?

All platform documents should use these networks for consistency.
